# GoodMorning
Waking up to sunrise and random sounds of nature or explosions.

Moving to the city has it advantages and disadvantages.
For one the noise is horrible and passing cars will constantly point their spotlights through your window, forcing you to let the blinds down all the way.
Which I can't stand since I need a bit of light when I wake up to get out of bed properly.

Being the outdoorsman I am, I present to you *GoodMorning* - the poor man's ambient wakeup!

It basically runs a fullscreen app which does a colour transition over time and plays some ambient music and nature sounds.
The idea is not new but I hate that all apps I have tried so far use the same sounds every morning.
So here you go. Random, extendible sounds.

You'd therefore have to have a monitor with speakers installed in your bedroom. But c'mon, it's 2017.

The app is still in early development and actually more for my personal use. 
But feel free to use and modify.
